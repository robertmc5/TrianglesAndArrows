    <p>Triangles, and therefore pointer or arrow-shaped structures can be made with some CSS tricks.</p>
    <p>This CSS trick can be seen explained online at <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/">https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>The gist of it is to make a border around no content. {It's just a border around a singularity.}</p>
    <p>When one side of the border is made transparent, the color of the connecting side seems to angle inward toward the center.</p>
    <p>Kinda like a picture frame side piece around a picture.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If the top and bottom border colors are transparent, and the left border color isn't, then it appears as a triangle pointing to the right.</p>
    <p>Whereas if the left and right border colors are transparent, and the bottom border color isn't, then it appears as a triangle pointing upward.</p>
    <p>And so forth.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A common use of this CSS trick functionality can be seen in the <em><strong>breadcrumb navigation</strong></em> shapes above.</p>
